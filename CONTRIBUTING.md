# Contributing

If you have any question or problem with _sbt-ci_ feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/alejandrohdezma/sbt-ci/issues) (or a [pull request](https://github.com/alejandrohdezma/sbt-ci/pulls) if you already have the solution :smile:).

People are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when discussing on the Github issues or PRs.

## How can I help?

_sbt-ci_ follows a standard [fork and pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) model for contributions via GitHub pull requests.

The process is simple:

 1. Find something you want to work on.
 2. Let us know you are working on it via GitHub issues/pull requests.
 3. Implement your contribution.
 4. Write tests.
 5. Update the documentation.
 6. Submit a pull request.

You will be automatically included in the contributors list as a contributor in the next release.

If you encounter any confusion or frustration during the contribution process, please create a GitHub issue and we'll do our best to improve the process.
